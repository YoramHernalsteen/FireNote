## FireNote

FireNote is a note-taking / task-making application built with javascript, React and a FireStore database. It uses React Router for page navigation, styled components for styling and, the FireStore authentication service. 

FireNote allows you to make task and notes and bind them to a category (work, groceries, home, family and random) and a stage (todo, in progress, on hold, done and NA). A due date is optional.
